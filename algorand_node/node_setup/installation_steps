The steps described on the link were followed to set up the algorand node: 
https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/#installation-with-a-package-manager

Installation steps:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gnupg2 curl software-properties-common
curl -O https://releases.algorand.com/key.pub
sudo apt-key add key.pub
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://releases.algorand.com/deb/ stable main"
sudo apt-get update

# To get both algorand and the devtools:
sudo apt-get install -y algorand-devtools

# Or, to only install algorand:
sudo apt-get install -y algorand

algod -v

The data directory will be "/var/lib/algorand" by default.

#Start, stop the node and check its status:
sudo systemctl start algorand
sudo systemctl stop algorand

#The status of the node can be checked by running:
goal node status -d /var/lib/algorand


#A new option can facilitate a status watch, -w which takes a parameter of time, in milliseconds, between two successive status updates. This will eliminate the need to repeatedly issue a status manually. Press ^c to exit the watch.
goal node status -w 1000

#Notice that the 5 Catchpoint status lines will disappear when completed, and then only a few more minutes are needed to sync from that point to the current block. 
**Once there is a Sync Time of 0, the node is synced and if fully usable. **
