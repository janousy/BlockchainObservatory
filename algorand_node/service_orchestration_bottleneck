#If during the data load period, the mainnet data directory changes in the algorand.service file out of your control, 
#follow the steps below to continue syncing to the correct directory:

#Stop the node before making any changes in the algorand.service file.
sudo systemctl stop algorand
sudo systemctl disable algorand

# OLD cd /lib/systemd/system
#Â sudo nano algorand.service

# NOTE: editing system unit files in /lib/systemd/system is not recommended 
# as they will be replaced again when ubuntu is updated.
# instead create a copy to /etc/systemd/system with systemctl edit --full <service>

sudo systemctl edit --full algorand

#Here change the second path in the "ExecStart" to the one you want the mainnet data to be loaded:
#For our VM server, we changed it from "/var/lib/algorand" to "/mnt/algorand"
# ----------------------
[Unit]
Description=Algorand daemon for mainnet in /mnt/algorand
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/algod -d /mnt/algorand
PIDFile=/var/lib/algorand/algod.pid
User=algorand
Group=algorand
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
# ----------------------

# check service config, which should load the unit file in /etc/system/systemd
systemctl cat algorand

#Then reload the deamon and start the algorand server. If it doesn't work with the first attempt, apply the following commands again:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable algorand
sudo systemctl start algorand

#When the node starts, it will continue from where it left. Also, if there is no data in the new directory, it will start from the beginning. 
#That's why you shouldn't move any mainnet data from the other directory to the new one, before changing the directory path following the steps above
#and restarting the node.
